- Put all images inside the images folder
- Put all css code inside the css folder
    - Use root referencing when linking to .css files so that can copy paste    easily, ie. /Images/BackGround.png rather than ../Images/Background.png
- Put all the reusable components eg. navbar, background template inside the "reusable components folder", then we can refer to that as the latest version

- Remember to push and fetch origin after editing
